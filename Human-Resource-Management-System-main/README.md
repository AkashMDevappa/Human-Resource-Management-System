# Human-Resource-Management-System
This project is entitled Human Resource Information System and was developed using PHP. This web application is a great help for a company.
We can track each employee what time, the date he can be assigned to different branches and I know what branch he used to be and so on. The system has a Multi-Login Feature and has 3 types of user roles which are the Super Admin (HR Head), Admin (HR Head), and Staff (HR Assistant). The Super Admin users are the ones who can manage all data of the system while the Admin and Staff can only manage the list of employees.
This Human Resource Information System Project was built using PHP, MySQL Database, and some plugins/libraries.
